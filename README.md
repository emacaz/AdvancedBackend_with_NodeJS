Welcome to my repos:

This repo is about a backend created with NodeJS,
I usually upload my code to my github profile, so this ainÂ´t
a tutorial or something similar but a project where I am
applying some knowledge I am acquired from my personal study
routine.

Anyway feel free to read it, to try to understand it
and to improve it if you find any mistake or something
to correct on it.

As always, ECZ :D
